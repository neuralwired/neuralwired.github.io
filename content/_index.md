title: "Hey, I’m neuralwired!"

I’m a Computer Science student who is exploring new ways to push code further.

### Things I’ve worked on

- A **Bi-LSTM model** for predicting Bitcoin prices  
- A **full-stack event platform** using React, Flask, Redis, and PostgreSQL  
- An **AI tool for detecting disinformation**, powered by Meta’s LLaMA 3.2  
- A combat bot that **won a robotics battle** with adaptive obstacle handling

Here, you’ll find posts about the little things I learn along the way, especially during those 2 AM debugging sessions.
